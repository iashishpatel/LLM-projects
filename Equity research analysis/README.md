#"Equity research analysis"

we will build news research tool where you can give news article URLs and asked the question and it will give you answer based on that article's. we will use langchain, openai API, and streamlit to build a news research tool that can be used by equity research analysts to conduct their research

**Why we need this tool if we already have ChatGPT**
- issue[1] = Copy-pasting articles in ChatGPT is tedious
- issue[2] = We need an aggregate knowledge base
- issue[3] = ChatGPT words limit is 3000 words only
